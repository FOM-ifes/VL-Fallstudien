	abstract = {Aim
The systematic study aims to provide a brief summary of existing techniques and technological advances used for measuring the body composition in an individual.
Methods
The different techniques used for the assessment of body composition parameters were discussed in the study as follows: densitometry, plethysmography, isotope dilution, whole body 40K counting, anthropometric, bioelectrical impedance analysis, ultrasound, DEXA, CT, MRI and thermal imaging.
Results
In the thermal imaging method, the percentage difference in abdominal skin temperature between normal and obese subject was found to be 4.45\%. In ultrasound imaging, we obtain three bands of white layers which act as an interface between skin-fat, fat-muscle and muscle-bone. The subcutaneous fat tissue and muscle thickness was measured as 4.23 mm and 31.75 mm respectively. The MRI of an abdomen region was performed at the site of the L3-L4 disc and the subcutaneous adipose tissue volume was measured as 1955.11 cm3.
Conclusion
The proposed study summarises the benefits and drawbacks of different techniques, as each technique has its own pros and cons. Among the imaging modalities studied, non-invasive imaging method such as thermal imaging and ultrasound was found to be a feasible imaging technique for the assessment of body composition in an individual.},

	abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

	abstract = {Objective
To identify which equation, Siri or Brozek, based on the two compartment model, provides a more accurate conversion of body density (BD) in percent body fat (\%BF) in a group of older adults.
Study design
Cross-sectional study.
Setting
Research Centre in Physical Activity, Health and Leisure, Faculty of Sport, University of Porto.
Participants
60 older adults, aged 60–92 years.
Measurements
Skinfold thickness was used to estimate BD through Visser et al. prediction equation. The conversion of BD to \%BF was done with Siri (\%BF-Siri) and Brozek (\%BF-Brozek) formulas and these determined values were both compared to Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (\%BF-DXA) evaluations.
Results
A strong correlation between the \%BF-DXA value and \%BF-Siri (r=0.91, p{\textless}0.001) and \%BF-Brozek (r=0.91, p{\textless}0.001) was found, although \%BF-Siri and \%BF-Brozek overestimated \%BF-DXA (p{\textless}0.001). The comparison of the \%BF-Siri and \%BF-Brozek mean values also revealed significant differences (p{\textless}0.001). The \%BF-Brozek reflects a better agreement than the \%BF-Siri with \%BF-DXA with respectively a mean difference of −4.0\%BF (limits of agreement = −10.9 to 2.9\%) and −5.7\%BF (−12.6 to 1.2). The Bland and Altman plots confirmed that \%BF-Brozek reflects a better agreement with \%BF-DXA.
Conclusion
The results of the present study show that the use of Brozek equation may correspond to a more accurate alternative than Siri equation for the conversion of BD in \%BF in older adults.},
